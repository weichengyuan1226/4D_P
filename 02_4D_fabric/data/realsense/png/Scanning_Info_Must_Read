IMPORTANT INFO FOR SCANNING 
###############################

Lidar scanning can be a tricky business, but here are some keys to getting good scans of the 4D printed objects.

1:  Never scan when there is sunlight
    Both ambient and direct sunlight cause noise issues when scanning and should be avoided at all costs.
    When stiching scans together, if there was sunlight in any or all of the scan, the output will be bumpy and unusable.

2:  Always scan from at least 30cm away from the object
    Set up your scan positions so that there is at least 30cm of distance between the lidar TCP and the object
    This will allow the camera to operate in its intended range and will produce cleaner scans.
    You know you are too close to an object when you start to see "hole punching" or an abnormal hole in the scan directly underneath the Lidar scanner

3: Play with the settings
    The settings in the control and post processing panel for the L515 are imporant sliders that will change the outcome of your scan
    There are two pre-made settings "4D_Small_Scans" for objects less than 40mm and "4D_Large_Scans" larger than 40mm that need stitching

4:Stiching Considerations
    For larger objects you will need to stich multiple scans together 
    in order to do this you will have to set up your L515 TCP in GH/Rhino so you know each scan position relative to the world XY
    when importing a new scan, it will automatically import to world XY, so with these new scan positions, you can import them into the right place for stitching

5: More to come I am sure, but for now get to scanning!
